                    "Since the enlightenment, humans have thought of themselves as inherently \u201cgood\u201dRepresentative headship asserts that the action of a representative results is seen as the action also for those united to him.The action of our federal head lead to not only a sinful nature, but also our condemnation, so in the same the action by our new federal head Christ we receive life. (Rom. 5 &amp; 1 Cor. 15)Total depravity does not conclude that man is not able to do good rather it teaches that the corruption of sin pollutes the person. Both body and spirit are corrupted by sin.Man is not relatively neutral in which they are able to accept or reject God. Man is a hater of God who can not understand the things of GodThe \u201csin that leads to death\u201d is a sin that lead to drastic chastisementMortal and Venial sins are antithetical to the bible because it supposes that there are some sins that won\u2019t lead to condemnation which in turn leads to a faulty salvationThe Roman Catholic idea of meritorious penance which is used for removal of mortal sin is an error and takes a blow at Christ atoning sacrifice for sin.Personal sin does not break the bond between them and Christ, but they do have a negative impact on communion with Christ.God created the world perfect, the reason the world is the way it is, is because man has to face the consequences for their sin.The truth gives eternal perspective to our temporal sufferings in a fallen world.UNANSWERED QUESTIONS (at least 3)Is this denial from this British monk the reason why so many believe in free will?In understanding the a-mil or post-mil position on the end times, how can it be that the man of lawlessness isn\u2019t literally or has already come and deceived?Why was the woman promised the coming seed that would reverse the curse?Why did God not destroy all man again as he did in the flood even though man remained sinful as we see even Noah was sinful?"

                    "Theology 103: Humans and Sin, Angels and DemonsNEW INSIGHTSAnthropology helps me with understanding who I am as a person. This answers the question of why we all are here.Anthropology also helps with dealing with the time such as what Charles Spurgen dealt with evolution starting with Charles Darwin. This is where I am happy to learn about sudden creationism.&nbsp;I noticed while going through Genesis 1 were the terms created, made, and formed. This was eye opening because I sometimes can gloss over these terms while reading and miss God's magnificent glory in creation.Imago Dei is a unique difference that we humans possess that all other creatures and animals don\u2019t possess. We are his representation not in the divine sense, but in the sense of the Trinitrian nature how we live in relationship with others&nbsp;&nbsp;Our conscience can get overridden by lies and errors which in turn misinforms the conscience.Scripture seems to support dichotomy and trichotomy where sometimes soul and spirit are interchangeable and other times they are not so interchangeable, but mean different thingsCreationism argument when it comes to the origin of the soul fails to understand that Adam creation is a unique creation, so using him for the argument that both the soul and body were created at the same time is wrong.Deut. 22:5 supports that God expects that said person to live according to the gender He granted them at birthAfter the creatures were created God seemed to still create Adam a helper, so we see that the creatures and animals weren\u2019t suitable for him.Homosexual unions cannot be rightly seen as marriages because it goes against God meaning for marriage.He create man and seen that man needed a companion and&nbsp; this companion must fulfill His command to procreateEx. 21:22-25 presents a strong case for life starting in the womb because of the severity of the punishment if the child in the mother is harmed.The soul/spirit lives in an intermediate state between death and bodily resurrection.UNANSWERED QUESTIONSCan one human constitution affect another human constitution?Similar to man initial command and go and fill the earth which they disobey which led to Gen. 11 in which they gathered in one place; is our command to go and make disciples of all nations can we be disobedient if we stick to trying to make disciples and our household and extended families?When talking about the role of government, is it wrong to disobey when they constitute something as being wrong such as the latest Canadian bill even though they are in place to punish people who do wrong?"

(Jh. 17:24) His divine will; (Mat. 26:39) His human willHis limited knowledge such as in passage like Mark 13 is a result of His voluntary surrender of the independent use of His divine attributesJesus was baptized in order to fulfill the Father\u2019s will. He in turned identified Himself with sinners to ultimately bear their sinsJesus veiling the truth in parables acted as both judgement and mercy for the hearers. Judgement because it kept them in darkness and mercy because He grant them to see the lightGod prepared mankind for the atoning substitutionary sacrifice&nbsp;of Christ by providing the instructions about sacrificeThe display of Jesus\u2019s glory is most often associated with His second advent, not His resurrection&nbsp;Glory in the minds of the prophets and apostles were mostly associated with Christ\u2019s resurrectionThe believers resurrection they share in the same gloryEvery believer is ultimately accountable to him (1 Cor. 3:10-15) which motivates us to please GodAt the fullness of time, God will gather together believers in the millennial kingdomThe real glory of eternity is when believers will reside in the presence of the Lord"

I thought this would\u2019ve been a good argument, but reading this section understanding that open theist and their disbelief in God\u2019s immutability.Immutability does not mean that God is static, nor that He doesn\u2019t act distinctly in time or possess true affectionsAnthropopathic language is God\u2019s figurative expression of how He explains His change in actions towards a personHis infinitude with regard to time is eternity, and His infinitude with regard to space is omnipresenceGod can experience time, but he is not controlled, confined, or condition by timeGod upholds the created order by being in every point of spaceGod does know what would have happened if circumstances would have been different, but they aren\u2019t possible because they are not apart of God\u2019s planGod\u2019s knowledge is perfect He is never learning, so He does not have to look into the future to see how would accept His salvationGod\u2019s knowledge has two aspects: Natural knowledge and free knowledgeNatural Knowledge: is His self-conscious knowledge of HimselfFree Knowledge: all things that become known in time by His sovereign will, all things that do not become known in time, and how He is manifested and not manifested by all things outside of HimHis natural knowledge is how He reveals himself to creationWe as creation can know God through His free knowledge because He decrees of how He would reveal Himself to creationGod\u2019s foreknowledge is not dependent on foresight of what humans would doScripture reveals God\u2019s power (Eph. 3:20)God\u2019s power is that he has a theoretical absolute power to do more than what He actually does but not inconsistent with His essenceDoctrine of divine perfection is the doctrine of divine blessedness"

I find React to be very powerful for something that seems so simple to use. There are many things that React offered that the others did not such as CSS animation. Working in VueJS I found it fairly difficult to work with CSS animation.
